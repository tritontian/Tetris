# Tetris
This is a Java based Tetris game course project.
<br>

The GUI was coded by Java swing, the logic for this project is to listen the eventkey pressed by user, and perform the proper action, such as rotation of the block, pause/continue the game.
<br>

The gaming board is resizable, and each time we open the game, it will generate a random background color, and the next block will be displayed on the righer upper JPanel. The demo picture has uploaded under the folder.
